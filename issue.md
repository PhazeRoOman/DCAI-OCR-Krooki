# How we write issues

## What are GitHub issues?

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub issues then please review the official [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) on them.

## How we write issues?

There are 3 category of issues that should be added to this repository:

### 1. Bug report

Use this to report on any issue in the application or the repository. For this you should use the Bug Report template. Here are the steps:

1. Click on the create new issue button.
2. You will be given an option to select a template.
3. Select the _Bug Report_ tempalate.
4. Start writing the issues based on the template.

### 2. Feature

Features are new additions to the application. Typically all the feature issues should be created before the beginning of the project. However, new feature issues could be created at the beginning of a new sprint as well. For this please use the Feature Template. The steps are below:

1. Click on the create new issue button.
2. You will be given an option to select a template.
3. Select the _Feature_ tempalate.
4. Start writing the issues based on the template.

### 3. Other

For anything that does not fall into these two categories, then please do not use a template and create an issue from scratch. 

An example would be if you have a question regarding implementation. Do not use the existing template but simply create the issues from a blank one. Steps are below:

1. Click on the create new issue button.
2. You will be given an option to select a template.
3. Don't use a template and click on the "Open a blank issue." link.
4. Start writing the issues.

## Issue Checklist

If you are unsure that you are writing an issue as per our standards then simply follow the checklist below:

- [ ] I used the _Bug Report_ template to report a bug/I used the _Feature_ template to report a bug/I created a blank issues to create an issue not related to a bug or a new feature.
- [ ] I gave the issues a clear title that describes it well. When someone reads the title they should understand what the issues is for.
